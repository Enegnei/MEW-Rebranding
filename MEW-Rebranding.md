| ![MyEtherWallet logo](https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/963925173886857216/AjKD6Bvw_200x200.jpg)| MyEtherWallet (MEW) is a "free, open-source, client-side interface for generating Ethereum wallets." MyEtherWallet LLC was founded by Kosala Hemachandra and Taylor Monahan in Los Angeles, California. The [repository](https://github.com/kvhnuke/etherwallet/graphs/contributors) was opened on August 9th; the [domain](https://web.archive.org/web/20150901202109/https://www.myetherwallet.com/#generate-wallet) was [registered](https://archive.is/7of3P) on August 19th 2015. |

**Twitter** gives its users the option to change their username (also known as 'handle') without having to create a new account and lose existing followers. The reasons for changing handles are numerous, but from a [business perspective](https://web.archive.org/web/20180215010737/https://mashable.com/2011/11/27/change-twitter-handle/#noxufxJ.x8qC) this often coincides with the launch of a new product / service, or as a way of improving brand recognition. As a general rule, **Twitter** suggests that "[you alert your followers before you change your username](https://web.archive.org/web/20180106145156/https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/change-twitter-handle)."

On December 23rd 2017, front-end developer Taylor Monahan ([@tayvano_](https://web.archive.org/web/20180215015344/https://twitter.com/tayvano_)) published an article in [**CoinDesk**](https://web.archive.org/web/20180215021408/https://twitter.com/coindesk/status/944567674927026177?lang=en) about user experience issues in the blockchain ecosystem. She described MyEtherWallet as "[the de-facto interface for interacting with the ethereum blockchain, especially when it comes to ethereum-based tokens](https://archive.is/jUg2I#selection-1585.216-1589.52)."

On February 8th 2018, Monahan changed the handle of the MEW account to "[MyCrypto](https://web.archive.org/web/20180210202039/https://twitter.com/MyCrypto/)," not only removing the +70k followers but disabling its verified status. Because this was done without warning, the MyEtherWallet account (reportedly now only controlled by MEW's co-founder Kosala Hemachandra) was one of the first to [tweet about the handle change](https://web.archive.org/web/20180209111258/https:/twitter.com/myetherwallet/status/961792085060808704?lang=en).

Over the next two days, Monahan and the MyCrypto team published three **Medium** articles in which they attempted to explain the account change and why the project had parted ways with Hemachandra:

+ "[A New Beginning: MyCrypto.com](https://archive.is/Drw5P)"
+ "[MyCrypto: What You Need To Know](https://archive.is/s4PcL)"
+ "[MyCrypto Launch FAQ](https://archive.is/9InbS)"

On February 14th, the [MyCrypto](https://web.archive.org/web/20180215143619/https://twitter.com/MyCrypto/status/963927289938374656?lang=en) team returned the account to [MyEtherWallet](https://web.archive.org/web/20180215142703/https://twitter.com/myetherwallet/status/963941339002937344?lang=en). MEW was also [re-verified by **Twitter**](https://web.archive.org/web/20180215143316/https://twitter.com/myetherwallet/status/964081188087283712?lang=en) the next day.
