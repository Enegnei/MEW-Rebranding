# The Rebranding of MyEtherWallet (MEW)

**Twitter** gives its users the option to change their username (also known as 'handles') without having to create a new account and lose existing followers. The reasons for changing handles are numerous, but from a [business perspective](https://web.archive.org/web/20180215010737/https://mashable.com/2011/11/27/change-twitter-handle/#noxufxJ.x8qC) this often coincides with the launch of a new product / service, or as a way of improving brand recognition. As a general rule, **Twitter** suggests that "[you alert your followers before you change your username](https://web.archive.org/web/20180106145156/https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/change-twitter-handle)."

On December 23rd 2017, front-end developer Taylor Monahan ([@tayvano_](https://web.archive.org/web/20180215015344/https://twitter.com/tayvano_)) published an article in [**CoinDesk**](https://web.archive.org/web/20180215021408/https://twitter.com/coindesk/status/944567674927026177?lang=en) about user experience issues in the blockchain ecosystem. She described MyEtherWallet (MEW), a client-side interface for generating Ethereum wallets, as "[the de-facto interface for interacting with the ethereum blockchain, especially when it comes to ethereum-based tokens](https://archive.is/jUg2I#selection-1585.216-1589.52)."

On February 8th 2018, Monahan changed the handle of the MEW account to "[MyCrypto](https://web.archive.org/web/20180210202039/https://twitter.com/MyCrypto/)," not only removing the +70k followers but disabling its verified status. Because this was done without warning, the MyEtherWallet account (reportedly now only controlled by MEW's co-founder Kosala Hemachandra) was one of the first to [tweet about the handle change](https://web.archive.org/web/20180209111258/https:/twitter.com/myetherwallet/status/961792085060808704?lang=en).

Over the next two days, Monahan and the MyCrypto team published three **Medium** articles in which they attempted to explain the account change and why the project had parted ways with Hemachandra:

+ "[A New Beginning: MyCrypto.com](https://archive.is/Drw5P)"
+ "[MyCrypto: What You Need To Know](https://archive.is/s4PcL)"
+ "[MyCrypto Launch FAQ](https://archive.is/9InbS)"
