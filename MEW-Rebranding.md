# The Rebranding of MyEtherWallet (MEW)

| ![MyEtherWallet logo](https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/963925173886857216/AjKD6Bvw_200x200.jpg)| MyEtherWallet (MEW) is a "free, open-source, client-side interface for generating Ethereum wallets." MyEtherWallet LLC was founded by Kosala Hemachandra and Taylor Monahan in Los Angeles, California. The [repository](https://github.com/kvhnuke/etherwallet/graphs/contributors) was opened on August 9th; the [domain](https://web.archive.org/web/20150901202109/https://www.myetherwallet.com/#generate-wallet) was [registered](https://archive.is/7of3P) on August 19th 2015. |

**Twitter** gives its users the option to change their username (also known as a 'handle') without having to create a new account and lose existing followers. The reasons for changing handles are numerous, but from a [business perspective](https://web.archive.org/web/20180215010737/https://mashable.com/2011/11/27/change-twitter-handle/#noxufxJ.x8qC) this often coincides with the launch of a new product / service, or as a way of improving brand recognition. As a general rule, **Twitter** suggests that "[you alert your followers before you change your username](https://web.archive.org/web/20180106145156/https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/change-twitter-handle)."

On December 23rd 2017, front-end developer Taylor Monahan ([@tayvano_](https://web.archive.org/web/20180215015344/https://twitter.com/tayvano_)) published an article in [**CoinDesk**](https://web.archive.org/web/20180215021408/https://twitter.com/coindesk/status/944567674927026177?lang=en) about user experience issues in the blockchain ecosystem. She described MyEtherWallet as "[the de-facto interface for interacting with the ethereum blockchain, especially when it comes to ethereum-based tokens](https://archive.is/jUg2I#selection-1585.216-1589.52)."

On February 8th 2018, Monahan changed the handle of the MEW account to "[MyCrypto](https://web.archive.org/web/20180210202039/https://twitter.com/MyCrypto/)," causing the account to split into one with the new handle and one with the old handle, which was removed of its +70k followers and verified status. Because this was done without warning, the MEW account (reportedly still run by Hemachandra) was one of the first to [tweet about the handle change](https://web.archive.org/web/20180209111258/https:/twitter.com/myetherwallet/status/961792085060808704?lang=en). From his personal account, Hemachandra described the account split as "[improper, perhaps unlawful](https://web.archive.org/web/20180215161602/https://twitter.com/kvhnuke_/status/961808501088468992?lang=en)," but upon being asked for further comment explained that he was "[unable to make any comments without discussing this situation with my lawyers.](https://web.archive.org/web/20180209183106/https:/twitter.com/kvhnuke_/status/961892055558496256?lang=en)" When asked why he described it that way, Monahan responded, "[I don't know. I don't know why other people do things. I'm sorry](https://web.archive.org/web/20180215150920/https://twitter.com/tayvano_/status/961891235018416128?lang=en)." 

On February 9th, Hemachandra released a statement about the split on **Reddit**:

> [During the transition yesterday, however, MEW’s Twitter account was switched from **@myetherwallet** to **@mycrypto**, and tens of thousands of MEW followers were left scratching their heads. Indeed, the change was unexpected, and I’m still in the process of determining the justification behind the switch, and how this issue will be resolved. I don’t know what the fall out from this will be ultimately, but I will not be on the offensive or defensive discussing the circumstances surrounding our decision to separate beyond my statement here.](https://archive.is/cVylW#selection-3079.72-3079.609)

People from the Ethereum community, as well as the general cryptocurrency space, continued to tweet at all four accounts [expressing](https://web.archive.org/web/20180215151637/https://twitter.com/iamjosephyoung/status/961804639124377600?lang=en) [confusion](https://twitter.com/Steven_McKie/status/961805370065760256), [disappointment](https://web.archive.org/web/20180215153008/https://twitter.com/spudowiar/status/961941151438835712?lang=en), [anger](https://web.archive.org/web/20180215152831/https://twitter.com/DenizOmer/status/961914511971307520?lang=en), and questions of whether they had been compromised. MyCrypto's first tweet instructed people to not "[freak out](https://web.archive.org/web/20180209042027/https://twitter.com/mycrypto/status/961769008436400128)" at the sudden and unannounced change, linking to the first of three blog posts. They later posted a "[condensed version](https://archive.is/s4PcL)" of that blog post, [PGP-signed](https://archive.is/jjOqP) by Monahan, along with [a picture of her with MyCrypto logo stickers](https://web.archive.org/web/20180215164259/https://twitter.com/tayvano_/status/961811401311334400?lang=en) to show she had not been "[kidnapped](https://web.archive.org/web/20180215164917/https://twitter.com/tayvano_/status/961813137593790465?lang=en)." [Ethereum BLUE](https://web.archive.org/web/20180215162754/https://www.etherblue.org/), an ERC20 token, claimed they had "[confirmed that **@mycrypto** is run by the real **@tayvano_** and **@spencecoin**](https://web.archive.org/web/20180215153441/https:/twitter.com/EthereumBlue/status/961827217264144386?lang=en)" because "[they reached out to us personally, and provided photo evidence](https://web.archive.org/web/20180215154218/https://twitter.com/EthereumBlue/status/961830101271760896?lang=en)."

Monahan also shared several paragraphs describing her "[emotional attachments to the MEW brand](https://web.archive.org/web/20180210141352/https://twitter.com/mycrypto/status/961885331183185924)."

> I have treated the MEW Twitter as my personal Twitter since day one. As much as I tried to let my emotional attachments to the MEW brand go as we were working through this whole transition, I have had daily, personal conversations with people via MEW's Twitter. Everyone following **@MyEtherWallet** did so because of a tweet that I tweeted and/or security announcements about the wider crypto ecosystem.
>
> I value the relationships and conversations and the trust that we have built and didn't want *that* to go into the unknown. Perhaps this is selfish. Selfishly, I didn't want to lose those relationships that I value and live to protect. I wanted to make sure that if there was a crazy hack somewhere in the ecosystem tomorrow, I could tweet about it to the people relying on us to tweet about it.
>
> Was this the right decision? I still don't know. Things could be different and it could be worse and it could be better. Regardless, I didn't expect this and I'm sorry for the confusion that it caused. I'm really sorry.

Despite claiming that she "didn't expect this," she had previously tweeted, "[So... my fears are coming true and I really don't like it.](https://web.archive.org/web/20180215160821/https:/twitter.com/tayvano_/status/961807654644404228?lang=en)" `Note: For readability, this message has been slightly edited from the original form.`

Within the two days after the split, Monahan and the MyCrypto team published three **Medium** articles in which they attempted to explain the account change and why the project had parted ways with Hemachandra:

+ "[A New Beginning: MyCrypto.com](https://archive.is/Drw5P)"
+ "[MyCrypto: What You Need To Know](https://archive.is/s4PcL)"
+ "[MyCrypto Launch FAQ](https://archive.is/9InbS)"

Sometime around February 11th, Monahan joined the first half of "[The Bitcoin Podcast #184](https://web.archive.org/web/20180215152427/https://twitter.com/thebtcpodcast/status/962700159896424449?lang=en)" to talk about [the circumstances of MyCrypto's launch](https://archive.is/iVMXb). Before stating that she felt "forced into this leadership position," she defended the decision to not give advanced notice to followers / users about the change:

> [23:30] One of the biggest questions that I'm seeing right now is, 'Why didn't you give us weeks and weeks of warnings?' Okay guys, sorry but... we've been dealing with these phishing attacks, these malicious attacks, these fake ICO addresses, for so long that I'm not going to extend the period of change-time.
>
> With an ICO, this is what happens: you do marketing, you do marketing, you do marketing, you start the countdown clock. You do more marketing, you're tweeting "one day left guys, you ready?! You ready to invest, you ready to do this?" Then about twelve hours later, the phishers come in and start throwing addresses at people and all these naïve investors just throw the money right into the phisher's hands.
>
> So there was no good way to do this. We're not going to pretend that this was flawlessly executed. But I will say that 'weeks and weeks' of announcements, or pre-announcements to the announcements... all it would have done is extend the period of confusion, let the phishers and the malicious players in this space get an even bigger toehold. 

Between February 13-14th, the [MyCrypto](https://web.archive.org/web/20180215143619/https://twitter.com/MyCrypto/status/963927289938374656?lang=en) team created a new account and returned the followers to [MyEtherWallet](https://web.archive.org/web/20180215142703/https://twitter.com/myetherwallet/status/963941339002937344?lang=en). MEW was also [re-verified by **Twitter**](https://web.archive.org/web/20180215143316/https://twitter.com/myetherwallet/status/964081188087283712?lang=en) the next day. However the confusion between the handles remains, as tweets made by the MEW account while it was under "MyCrypto" were [not](https://web.archive.org/web/20180215023651/https:/twitter.com/myetherwallet/status/961769008436400128?lang=en) [deleted](https://web.archive.org/web/20180215023909/https://twitter.com/myetherwallet/status/961784924826030080?lang=en) after the transition was reversed.
